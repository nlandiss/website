					<p class="projectCopy2"> 
						I wrote and implemented HTML and CSS code to produce a new Email alert format for CommPRO.biz, a marketing new aggregate site. I used this formatting experience to produce two email alert examples during my week-long internship with the company. Please visit them via the links below.

					<p class="projectCopy2"> 
						The Haverford Review is the only completely student run literary magazine on Haverford's Campus. I re-instituted the magazine as a presence on campus by compiling an editorial board, soliciting submissions from students, and organizing everything together with my design team into the beautiful finished product.  We are currently the only online magazine operating at Haverford.

						I was a student studying abroad in Paris. I think pictures speak better than words, so my blog tried to capture my experiences through my camera lens.  This project taught me a lot about blogging, gaining readers, and connecting with an audience.
